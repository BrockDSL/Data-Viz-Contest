The Brock University Digital Scholarship Lab invites you to show your skills in our annual Data Visualization contest!

Starting on November 1st, you will have 1 month to create your best data visualization using one of the three datasets provided.  Entries will be reviewed by our panel of judges on December 1st based on the following criteria:

 1.  Comprehension: How easy is it to see and understand the point(s) your visualization makes and why they are relevant?
 2.  Insight: How innovative are the discoveries you made in the data?  
 3.  Aesthetics: Does it look good?
 
Submissions can be any type of data visualization you want!  Digital submissions can be sent to [DSL@Brocku.ca](mailto:dsl@brocku.ca) with "Data Visualization Contest Entry" as the subject line.  If your file is too large to send via e-mail or has special requirements, please contact [DSL@Brocku.ca](mailto:dsl@brocku.ca) and we will work out an apropriate submission method for you.

This contest is only open to brock students.  Only submissions recieved from a brock email (@brocku.ca) will be considered for judging.

The chosen winner will get a $25 Amazon gift card and bragging rights for the year!
