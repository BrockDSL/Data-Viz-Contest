The Brock University Digital Scholarship Lab invites you to show your skills in our annual Data Visualization contest!

Starting on November 1st, you will have 1 month to create your best data visualization using one of the datasets provided.  Entries will be reviewed by our panel of judges on December 1st based on the following criteria:

 1.  Comprehension: How easy is it to see and understand the point(s) your visualization makes and why they are relevant?
 2.  Insight: How innovative are the discoveries you made in the data?  
 3.  Aesthetics: Does it look good?
 
Submissions can be any type of data visualization you want!  Digital submissions can be sent to [DSL@Brocku.ca](mailto:dsl@brocku.ca) with "Data Visualization Contest Entry" as the subject line.  

If your submission is too large to send via e-mail or has special requirements, please contact [DSL@Brocku.ca](mailto:dsl@brocku.ca) and we will work out an appropriate submission method for you.

This contest is only open to Brock students.  Only submissions received from a Brock email (@brocku.ca) will be considered for judging.

The chosen winner will get a $25 Amazon gift card and bragging rights for the year!
